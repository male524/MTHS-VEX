        <h2 style="color: white">Glacier 612A was a 4 student team with 3 freshmen and one sophomore. Their goal was to build a robot that could both score points in towers and stacks so they built a forklift bot that could reach the lowest cup.</h2>

        <h2 style="color: white">Solar Flare 612B was a 4 student team, with 3 freshmen and one junior. Oliver Easton was the team captain. During the 2019-2020 competition season, they built a robot that was able to stack up to 3 cubes and place them in the towers. They were a very new team with lots of freshmen but they did very well.</h2>

        <h2 style="color: white">Inferno 612C, formerly known as Heat Misers, is a girl-powered team (meaning the majority of the members are female). Brooke Rinehimer was the team captain. They made a four-wheel-drive claw bot that could stack up to two cubes in a corner in the 2019-2020 season. They also made a four-wheel-drive robot in the 2018-2019 season that could easily flip the caps and shoot the middle flag. Heat Misers did very well in the 2018-2019 season and made it to VEX State for Washington.</h2>

        <h2 style="color: white">Frostbyte 612X was a 5 member team, with Maximus Lockhart as the team captain. They made a 6 wheel drive robot for the 2019-2020 competition, Tower Takeover. Though they werenâ€™t able to score points very well with this bot, they were great support and had the ability to help their teammates by making sure the other team could not score. In the 2018-2019 season, they created a four-wheel-drive robot that could move very quickly, flip caps, and shoot a ball at the middle flag. They could also climb straight onto the middle platform, and shove any robot that was on it right off! Frostbyte made it to VEX State and TSA Nationals.</h2>

They made a four-wheel-drive robot for the 2019-2020 competition that could easily stack up to six cubes in the corner and had a method of scoring in the towers as well. They did very well in the last season and even made it to VEX State.</h2>

For the 2019-2020 season, they made a robot that could stack a few blocks and could move at a pretty good speed. They did well in most of the competitions even though they were mostly freshmen and new to the club.</h2>
