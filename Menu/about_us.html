        <h2 style="color: white">Solar Flare 612B was a 4 member team, with 3 Freshman and one Junior, with Oliver Easton as the team captain. During the 2019-2020 competition season, they built a robot that was able to stack up to 3 cubes, and place in the towers as well. Even though they were a very new team with lots of Freshman, they were able to do well.

        <h2 style="color: white">Inferno 612C, formerly known as Heat Misers, is a girl power team, meaning the majority of the members are female, with Brooke Rinehimer as the team captain. They made a four wheel drive claw bot that could stack up to two cubes in a corner in the 2019-2020 season, and made a four wheel drive robot that could easily flip the caps and shoot the middle flag in the 2018-2019 season. Heat Misers did well in the 2018-2019 season, and made it to VEX State for Washington.</h2>

        <h2 style="color: white">Frostbyte 612X was a 5 member team, with Maximus Lockhart as the team captain. They made a 6 wheel drive robot for the 2019-2020 competition, Tower Takeover. Though they werenâ€™t able to score points very well with this bot, they were a great support and able to help their teammates by making sure the other team could not score. In the 2018-2019 season, they created a four wheel drive robot that could move very quickly, flip caps, and shoot a ball at the middle flag. They could also climb straight onto the middle platform, and shove any robot that was on it right off! Frostbyte made it to VEX State, and TSA Nationals.</h2>

They made a four wheel drive robot for the 2019-2020 competition that could easily stack up to six cubes in the corner, and had a method of scoring in the towers as well. They did very well in the last season, even being a newly formed team, and made it to VEX state.</h2>

        <h2 style="color: white">Heatwave 612Z was a 5 member team, with 4 Freshman and a Sophomore, and Annabelle Millis as team captain. For the 2019-2020 season, they made a robot that could stack a few blocks, and could move at a pretty good speed. They did well in most of the competitions, and it was especially difficult for them since nearly the entire team was Freshman, and very new to the club.
